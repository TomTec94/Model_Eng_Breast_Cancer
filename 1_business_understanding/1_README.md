# Business Understanding

## Project Overview

**Objective:**
Develop an interpretable classification model that predicts whether a possible breast cancer tumor 
is malignant or benign with high accuracy (F1 score > 0.95). The model 
should also be interpretable to help oncologists understand its predictions
and foster trust in the technology.

**Key Tasks:**
1. Create a classification model with high accuracy and interpretability.
2. Identify key features influencing the model's predictions.
3. Communicate the results effectively to non-expert stakeholders.

## Success Criteria

The success criteria for this project are based on the SMART framework:

- **Specific:** Develop a classification model for breast tumor diagnosis 
    that achieves high accuracy and interpretability.
- **Measurable:** Achieve an F1 score > 0.95 on the given dataset.
- **Achievable:** Use the provided dataset and interpretable machine learning techniques to develop the model.
- **Relevant:** Address the oncologists' concerns about trustworthiness and interpretability.
- **Time-bound:** Complete the project within the agreed timeline (2 weeks).

## Roles and Responsibilities

- **Data Scientist:** Develop and validate the classification model, ensure interpretability, and communicate findings.
- **Domain Expert (Oncologist):** Provide insights on clinical relevance and interpretability requirements.
